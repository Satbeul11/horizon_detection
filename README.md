This repository is for research paper.

I'll write a research paper which is find a horizon in the ocean image.

It is important for maritime industry, because it reduces the time consuming and increases the perfect of detection.

I'm focusing on the machine that a drone detecing a tuna group in the sea.

Combining my method to tuna detecting drone will have a good performance in the fishing page.

So, I find the reasearch that using ROI for detecing a horizon line and I will combine that with a algorithm or a deep-learning method.

Also, conducting a reasearch about a how to reduce the noise by using filter and how to efficiently find the ROI box and how to find the horizon in the ROI box well.
